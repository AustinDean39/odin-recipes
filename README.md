The Odin Project's HTML Recipes Website project

This is the first of the projects I am doing as part of the Odin Project's curriculum. 

This project will be testing my knowledge of HTML to make a website for recipes.
I hope to display my knowledge of creating basic web pages, linking them together, and (maybe) embedding images onto them.

I will revisit this document once I have finished the project to reflect on what went well and what skills I will need to work on.
