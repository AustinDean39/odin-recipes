The Odin Project's HTML Recipes Website project

This is the first of the projects I am doing as part of the Odin Project's curriculum. 

This project will be testing my knowledge of HTML to make a website for recipes.
I hope to display my knowledge of creating basic web pages, linking them together, and (maybe) embedding images onto them.

I will revisit this document once I have finished the project to reflect on what went well and what skills I will need to work on.


-- UPDATE: 

I have finished the project (for now), and I have definitely learned a lot. I got quite a bit of practice with HTML lists, as well as linking different web pages together. I definitely got some practice in with revising/testing code, too.

I also learned a lot more about the git workflow, particularly commits and commit syntax, throughout this project. I probably could have combined some commits together, but I learned a lot and hope that my practice now and in the future will only help me learn and improve more. :)
